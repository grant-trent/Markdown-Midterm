# High School

High School was a good time for me. I made a lot of firends and had some really good times. Some of the best years of my life. 
I was on varsity of my high school golf team and would travel to play in tournaments.
I averaged around mid 80's. Unfortunatlly I was in a car accident after my sophomore year that left me parralized form the chest down.
After my accident, I realized just how precious life is and I swore to myself that I would cherish every day I had left.

I was able to graduate top 50 in my class with a 3.8 GPA, even after missing an entire semester due to my car accident.
