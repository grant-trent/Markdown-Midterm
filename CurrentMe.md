# The Present

Currently, I am a junior and looking to get a bachelors degree in IT. So far I have enjoyed my college experience. It has its pros and cons compared to high school.
I have much more freedom in college, which is viewed most of the time as a good thing, but can also be a bad thing. Sometimes I get in my own way if that makes any sense.
I spend my week days doing homework, going to class, and studying. I spend my weekends watching football and playing **rocket league**.

Here is a link to my [rocket league tracker](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/rocket-league/profile/steam/76561198845926305/overview) if you are interested in checking out my skill level.
